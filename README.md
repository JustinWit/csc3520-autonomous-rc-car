# csc3520-autonomous-rc-car
Finals project for machine learning. Using neural networks to predict rc car steering and throttle values.


Ensure following packages are installed properly:
* numpy
* json
* os
* CV2
* pdb
* tensorflow
* scikit-learn


Then select one of the following networks to use:
* seperate_networks.py
* steering_to_throttle.py
* throttle_to_steering.py
* img_filter_CNN.py
* img_transformation.py

then run the python file
```shell
python3 <name_of_file>.py
```
